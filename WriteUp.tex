% Note that the a4paper option is mainly intended so that authors in
% countries using A4 can easily print to A4 and see how their papers will
% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in
% draft mode.
%
\documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}
% Add the compsoc option for Computer Society conferences.

% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  \usepackage{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  \graphicspath{C:/Users/Scott/Desktop/Final_Project/}

% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

%\boldmath
This paper presents a program which captures images from a web cam, detects human facial features, displays the results via a graphical user interface (GUI), and saves the data to a file. A case study highlights the program's specific application to non-human primate training in behavioral experiments and operates under the assumption that the animal is paying attention during positive feature detection. The user can choose to detect 1 of 6 different features and define the attention threshold per trial, which determines the percent positive frames constituting a trial in which the animal was inferred to have been paying attention. The GUI displays real-time data from each trial and the log file saves data from every frame.

\section{Introduction}
% no \IEEEPARstart
Scientists often use non-human primates to study neural activity \emph{in vivo} by training the animal to perform behavioral tasks and recording the extra-cellular potential of cortical neurons. In a typical experimental set-up, the researcher trains the animal to recognize a stimulus and acquire the skills necessary to perform the desired behavioral response. Before collecting experimental data, the animal must demonstrate a certain level of task proficiency, which is currently evaluated according to the total number of trials and success rate. However, proficiency is a function of both skill and attention, a distinction which this method does not address. The purpose of this particular application of feature detection is to provide an improved evaluation of task proficiency. 

The most common method calculates success rate as a function of successfull and unsuccessful trials. A successful trial occurs when the animal recognizes the stimulus and correctly performs the behavioral response. However, unsuccessful trials can fall into one of two categories. On one hand, the animal may recognize the stimulus but fail due to an unskilled response. On the other hand, the animal may become distracted and fail by not recognizing the stimulus. Both responses decrease the success rate and increase the total trials. As a result, the researcher does not have enough information to determine whether the lack of proficiency is related to skill or attention. The implementation of feature detection distinguishes unskilled and distracted responses. Our goal is to provide the researcher with a qualitative analysis of the attention of the monkey to adjust training strategies within the session and quantitative data that can be analyzed after the session to determine strategies for future session.

\section{Methods}
The tracking program utilizes and extends numerous open source libraries, including OpenCV, Qt, and ITK to capture and process images through a graphical user interface.  After VGA color images are captured, they are converted to grayscale and facial features are detected using Haar classifier cascades and the cvHaarDetectObjects() function included with OpenCV.  This function utilizes Haar wavelets (similar to Fourier transforms) to detect features based on a precompiled set of data contained in an .xml file.  In addition to .xml files for basic facial features, OpenCV also includes a Haar training utility that can create custom object classifiers using a large data set of images that are positive and negative for the desired feature.  While this approach requires large numbers of image files and intensive processing power, it affords researchers the flexibility to track any definable feature.  After tracking, a rectangle is superimposed to indicate the location of the selected feature.  The program records the number of successfully tracked frames, as well as qualitatively determining whether the test animal was paying attention in a given trial (based on the slider value).  This information is displayed graphically via trial counters and an attention progress bar.  Variables are also saved to a comma-separated (.csv) log file for post-processing.  The log filele includes the timestamp, trial number, feature being tracked, whether or not the feature was detected, and the time epoch.

\section{Results}
When the checkbox is selected, the current program successfully tracks all 6 features and displays a red rectangle superimposed around the feature on the captured image. After each frame, the program stores the time stamp in milliseconds, the current trial, the feature being detected, the detection result, and the current epoch in separate dynamic arrays indexed by frame number. The stored variables and the corresponding data types are summarized in table \ref{tab:data types}. The features are assigned numbers, with $-1$ corresponding to no feature detection and positive numbers corresponding to the order on the GUI. The detection returns a $1$ for a success, $0$ for a failure, and $-1$ if the feature detection is turned off. Currently, 3 trial epoch are recorded, beginning with 0, but this parameter could be modified for different experiments.

\hline

\hline
\color{blue}{double} & \color{blue}int & \color{blue}int & \color{blue}int & \color{blue}int\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

For testing purposes, the program calls a random number generator at the end of each frame to simulate cycling through three trial epochs. A trial ends at the conclusion of the third epoch. After each trial, the program calculates the number of frames in which the feature was detected during that trial and compares it to the attention threshold defined by the slider on the GUI in \ref{fig:current gui}. If the number of positive frames is greater than the threshold, the animal was inferred to have been paying attention and the successful trial counter increases by 1. If lower than threshold, the unsuccessful trial counter increases by 1. The Save Log button generates a .csv log file with columns corresponding to the recorded variables and rows corresponding to the captured frames. The file is also automatically generated upon exit of the program. When the recorded variables are written to the file, the frame index resets. If the frame numbers reach 1000, the pre-allocated size of the arrays, the data will automatically be written to file and the frame index reset. The current GUI implimentation is displayed in figure \ref{fig:current gui}.

\section{Discussion}
The program accomplishes the goal of providing the user with both a qualitative and quantitative assessment of human attention. The GUI provides trial by trial data in real time to adjust training methods within the session. The log file provides frame by frame data off-line to adjust training methods for future trials. However, the feature detection algorithm does not detect non-human primate features. As mentioned in the methods, the feature detection algorithm relies on .xml files from a large data set of positive and negative features. The files used in this program are compiled from human data, and it is assumed that similar files compiled from non-human primate data would be sufficient to detect animal features.

When the algorithm successfully detects a feature, the captured frame rate is on average 3 Hz, as defined in the Qt code. However, if the algorithm is unable to detect a feature, the captured frame rate slows down significantly. This is a problem even when compiled in release mode. The current algorithm spends too much time attempting to find the desired feature instead of labeling it as a negative frame and capturing a new image. This is a bug that could be fixed in a future version.

The transition between trial epochs and thus from trial to trial is currently mediated by a random number generator. In order to receive the experimental signal to change trial epochs from the controller machine, the current code would need to be incorporated into the custom software connecting the three experimental machines. It was determined that this would not be feasible within the timeline of this project. However, the custom software does include a number of C++ modules and it would be possible to subscribe our code as an additional module.

\section{Conclusion}
Our program uses human feature tracking as a successful proof-of-concept to indicate attention. A future version will be optimized for non-human primate features and will provide a graphical history of the past 100 trials to compliment the counters on the current GUI. This will enable the user to determine the pattern of attention for recent history.

A final study will be needed to test for false positives and false negatives. However, in this particular application, our program is merely a training tool and exact statistical accuracy is not required. Instead, the final metric will be judged by the efficacy with which the researcher can train the animal.
